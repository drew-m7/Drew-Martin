        <h4>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;I am Drew Martin, I grew up in Roanoke, IL and I am 22 years old. I attended Roanoke-Benson High Scool.
          I finished my associates degree in information systems in &nbsp;&nbsp;2020 at Illinois Central College.
        
          I finished my bachelors degree in computer science at Illinois State University!
        
          Along the way, I've had some really cool opportunities &nbsp;&nbsp;to intern at <a href="https://www.cloudpointgeo.com/">Cloudpoint Geospatial</a> and <a href="https://mirus.io/">Mirus Research</a>.
         
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;I have had many different jobs over the years, from automotive detailing to landscaping and construction! However, my most relevant work has been at Cloutpoint &nbsp;&nbsp;Geospatial and Mirus Research.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;At Cloudpoint Geo I worked as a GIS intern to gather data, analyze data, and improve web map applications built with arcGIS. In 2021, I began working
          at Mirus &nbsp;&nbsp;Research, a super cool software company in Bloomington, IL, where I was able to gain some amazing experience as a developer. My focus was 
          mainly on frontend &nbsp;&nbsp;dev, working with Vue.js, but I also occasionally worked on backend with Python. I have been able to work on developing some really cool new features for various &nbsp;&nbsp;clients,
          track down bugs, work on accessibility of client's web applications, and gain a ton of new skills related to software development and CI/CD!  
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;I am passionate about helping people through understanding and solving problems to improve their lives and meet their needs, and am always eager to learn &nbsp;&nbsp;something new or tackle a challenging problem!
          I am always open to new and interesting opportunities!
