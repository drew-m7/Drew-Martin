          &nbsp;&nbsp;I am Drew Martin, I grew up in the small town of Roanoke, IL and I am 22 years old. I attended Roanoke-Benson High Scool.
          I finished my associates degree in &nbsp;&nbsp;information systems in 2020 at Illinois Central College.
        
          I will soon graduate with my bachelors degree in computer science in 2022 at Illinois State University.<br></br>
        
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, I've had some really cool opportunities to intern at <a href="https://www.cloudpointgeo.com/">Cloudpoint Geospatial</a> and <a href="https://mirus.io/">Mirus Research</a>.
